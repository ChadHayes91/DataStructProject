Data Structures Summer18 Project

Adding a small changelog (SY)  
6/30/18:  
Imported standard 2D assets  
Added colliders and tweaked physics to player model  
Cleaned up level design for future infinite loop  

The level 2 was created to make the game more of a super mario bros platformer.
With an open world concept to go inbetween worlds to new levels and less of a side scrowler
platformer.
